# Neural-Network-Regression-and-Minimization-using-Genetic-Algorithm
In this project, I fitted a Neural Network to given data, then used genetic algorithm to find its minimum.


1) "pytorch" library is used for training a Neural Network for regression task
2) "geneticalgorithm" module is used for finding the minimum of the Neural Network function.
